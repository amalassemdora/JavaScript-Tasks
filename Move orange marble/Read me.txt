Create an animation on the page that makes an orange 
marble move to the next location in the line every second. Allow 
the user to stop the animation by placing the cursor on any 
marble. The animation will restart again once the user remove
the cursor from that marble. Add your own interesting feature 
to the script that tinkers with the speed or location of images
